## Overview

- [] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Search for GitHub users by their username

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use the styled component's advanced concept of a theme provider in order to make a light/dark mode version of the application.

I also learned about a Javascript library called Moment.js that helps to format dates returned from the github users API into a more readable format.

### Continued development

- [] Fix the error message if a user does not exist
- [] Clean up styles and code
- [] Fix link redirecting error

### Useful resources

- [Moment JS Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/) - This helped me with the date formatting.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
